## :telescope: Way of Design and Development

The design and development process is structured into several phases to ensure a comprehensive and efficient workflow. Each phase focuses on specific tasks that contribute to the overall success of the project.

### Phase 1: Conceptualization
- **Proof of Concept**: Developing a prototype to validate the feasibility of the idea.
- **Requirement Gathering**: Collecting detailed requirements from stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations.

### Phase 2: Planning and Analysis
- **Trait and Interface Identification**: Defining the key traits and interfaces required for the project.
- **Development Governance Rules**: Establishing rules and guidelines to govern the development process.
- **Module Breakdown**: Dividing the project into manageable modules for better organization and focus.
- **Fitness Boundary Setup**: Setting up boundaries to ensure the project meets the desired fitness criteria.
- **Dependency Management Selection**: Choosing the appropriate tools and strategies for managing dependencies.

### Phase 3: Implementation
- **Project Seeding**: Git Respository creation, porject skeleton and conventions
- **Code Development**: Writing and developing the codebase according to the defined requirements and guidelines.
- **Logging Strategy**: Implementing a logging strategy to track and monitor application behavior.
- **Application Analytics**: Integrating analytics to gather insights on application usage and performance.
- **Caching Strategy**: Setting up caching mechanisms to improve application performance.
- **Unit Testing**: Writing unit tests to ensure the code functions as expected.
- **Quality Scans**: Performing quality scans to identify and address potential issues.
- **Documentation**: Creating comprehensive documentation to support the development and usage of the application.
- **CI/CD Workflow Setup**: Setting up continuous integration and continuous deployment workflows to automate the build and deployment process.

### Phase 4: Deployment and Maintenance
- **Monitoring**: Implementing monitoring solutions to keep track of application performance and health.
- **Disaster Recovery Planning**: Planning for disaster recovery to ensure business continuity in case of unexpected events.
- **Hand Over**: Completing the project and handing over the deliverables to the stakeholders.

Each phase is designed to build upon the previous one, ensuring a smooth and efficient development process from start to finish.
